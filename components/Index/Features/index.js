                  Current life cycle assessment reporting is costly, laborious,
                  and time-consuming process which yields referential data
                  rather than real-time data.In addition, product life cycle
                  assessment reports are often analogous to financial models,
                  often employing a top-down method for life cycle assessment.
                  These factors degrade the veracity of current product LCA
                  reports, becoming a tool purely for sustainability reporting.
